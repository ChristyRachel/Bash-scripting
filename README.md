# Bash-scripting

This repository contains the codes I am practicing in Bash, which is the widelu used shell. It is the short of BOurne Again Shell. In this we are combining commands to scripts, so it is  short and fairly straight forward. So it will saves time and avoid typos. Bash is preinstalled in Linux. 
By using the command "bash --version", we can check which version is available in our linux system. 
Or if some other shell is available in the system, we can find it by "echo $SHELL" command. 
Just by running command "bash" we can move to a bash shell for bash sripting. 
Here I am doing in NANO editor.
